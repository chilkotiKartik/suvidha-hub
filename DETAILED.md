# Smart Urban Virtual Interactive Digital Helpdesk Assistant (SUVIDHA) - 2026

## Problem Statement
Participants are required to design and develop a Smart Urban Digital Helpdesk Assistant (SUVIDHA) — a public-facing, touch-based kiosk interface for customer interaction in civic utility offices. The solution should address real-world challenges of modern urban governance by improving accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in citizen–government interactions.

The objective is to build a single, integrated, self-service digital kiosk capable of delivering essential public utility services across multiple departments, including:

- **Electricity Utility Offices**
- **Gas Distribution Offices**
- **Municipal Corporations (Water Supply, Waste Management)**

The proposed kiosk solution must support a multilingual user interface, secure citizen authentication, service request and complaint submission, document upload functionality, real-time application status tracking, and automated receipt generation. The system should be scalable, reliable, and designed for intuitive use by citizens of diverse backgrounds.
